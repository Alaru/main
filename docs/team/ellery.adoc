== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added a display picture/status to all persons in the application.
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: https://stackoverflow.com/users/2970947/elliott-frisch[Elliott Frisch] from stackoverflow on the SHA-256 hash algorithm used to generate the name of the image file.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
